===== Minesweeper =====
This program is a recreation of Minesweeper in Java.
To play the game, all you have to do is run it.

Press the Play button to start a game, where you will
then be prompted to select a game size. Your options are:

    [*] Beginner (8 x 8, 10 mines)
    [*] Intermediate (16 x 16, 40 mines)
    [*] Expert (24 x 24, 99 mines)

These values were chosen as they were the original sizes
available when Minesweeper was first created.

Upon selecting a game size and pressing Begin, you can
start playing the game.

Click on a cell to clear it. If it has any adjacent mines,
it will appear with a number inside of it. If it is a bomb,
it will be outlined in red, and the game will end.

If you successfully clear all the cells without clicking on
a mine, you win the game.
